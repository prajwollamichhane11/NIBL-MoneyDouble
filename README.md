# NIBL-MoneyDouble
<p>NIBL has recently launched its money double plan in 7.5 years duration.<b>Should you invest your money on this plan ?</b></p>
<p>So, I perfomed some visualizations to check if it is a good thing or not.</p>
<h3>Following things are visualized</h3>
  <li>Amount of Sum and there differences from the compounded interest p.a.</li>
  <li>Continuous Distribution up to the given amount</li>

<h3>5 Thousand</h3>
	<img src = "./5K.png">
<h3>10 Thousand</h3>
	<img src = "./10K.png">
<h3>1 Lakh</h3>
	<img src = "./1Lak.png">
<h3>10 Lakh</h3>
	<img src = "./10Lak.png">
<h3>1 Crore</h3>
	<img src = "./1Crore.png">
<h2>My Conclusion</h2>
<p>Well, if you have a lot of money, you can invest on this plan. But, I do not think it makes any difference.</p>
